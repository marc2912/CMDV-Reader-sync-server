// Command cmdv-sync-server runs the reference sync server for CMDV Reader.
//
// Deliberately thin. Everything worth testing — reading the environment, validating it, preparing
// the database directory, routing, storage — lives in internal packages, because none of it is
// reachable by a test from a main package. What is left here is the order things happen in and what
// the operator is told.
//
// TLS is not terminated here. Anyone self-hosting already has a reverse proxy that does certificates
// better than this ever would, and half-doing it here would invite someone to run it directly on the
// internet with a certificate nobody renews.
