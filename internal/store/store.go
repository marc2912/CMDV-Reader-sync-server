// Package store is the whole of persistence: two tables, an append, and a page.
//
// What is absent is the point. There is no kind, no document identity, no record timestamp, no
// unique constraint beyond the primary keys, and no upsert — so there is nothing here that can hold
// an opinion about what the app's data means, and adding a new kind of synced data to the app
// requires no change to this file.
//
// Entries are immutable and nothing is ever deleted. That is what removes contention: two devices
// asserting different versions of one record both survive, and the app folds them in sequence order.
