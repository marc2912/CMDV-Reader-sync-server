// model — which is what makes it possible to add a synced data type to the app without touching

// makes the fixtures byte-stable and therefore usable as a cross-implementation check.

// client may call it twice per sync, once to import and once to export — that flow is the app's
// business, and keeping the server ignorant of it means the app can change it without a server
// release.
